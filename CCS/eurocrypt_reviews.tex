A previous version of this paper was submitted to EUROCRYPT 2022. The paper
has since undergone a major revision. The reviews bellow are the initial
reviews (i.e. prior to rebuttal phase). We note that, although we received
the rejection notification befor submitting to Usenix we did not receive the
final (updated) reviews.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item \begin{verbatim} Paper summary
-------------
In this work, the authors introduce a new CGKA primitive called
server-aided CGKA or saCGKA that tries to model how most E2EE SGM protocols
are deployed in practice, i.e., in the presence of highly available server
mediating the communication between the participants of SGM. The authors
use this server as a mailboxing service and leverages the computation
capabilities of the server to improved the bandwidth requirements for
participants (especially, receivers). The authors model the security of
saCGKA with an active adversary who completely controls the mailboxing
service and can expose secrets of the participants. The authors also
provide a clean construction using several building blocks (some new):
mmPKE with a modified security definition over the state of the art [50],
Reducible Signatures and Weighted Accumulators. These building blocks are
formalized independently and could find other applications.

Novelty, methodology and technical correctness
----------------------------------------------
The paper discussed related work in sufficient details and clearly state
how they compare. The contributions of this work (and how they improve over
the state-of-the-art) are clearly specified.

Technical quality
-----------------
I have a few technical questions:

1) Weighted accumulators: I am confused with this primitive. You insist
that the weights do not matter for the security, but the abstraction itself
is unclear to me. Vrfy doesn't take w as input. Are you proving \exists w
\in N such that (x,w) \in X? Could you please elaborate on this?

2) Reducible Signatures: This notion has similarities to malleable
signatures (without privacy). Could you please discuss this.

3) Fig 4: I am not being able to understand the inputs of Sign_S() and
Verify oracles here: where are sk',vk' coming from? I would imagine for
this version of the game, you will give a MAC and MAC-verify oracle. 4)
saCGKA definition: Your threat model is against active adversaries but your
security definition seems to be making some arbitrary restrictions on the
adversary's capabilities. These restrictions significantly weakens your
primitive.

a. F_AKS: as you discuss already, realistically parties can be corrupted
before they join, implying leakage of their long-term secrets. But this is
not part of your threat model.

b. You do not let the adversary modify or leak the randomness used by the
protocol. This is a strange limitation considering you are considering
active adversaries!

Finally, formalization of saCGKA does not have any correctness guarantee!

Editorial quality
-----------------
The editorial quality of this manuscript is poor. Apart from several typos
(see below), I find the flow of the paper hard to follow. the paper reads
well up to Section 6. In section 7, there is a sudden jump to security
discussion of SAIK without actually providing any intuition for the
construction. I had to read Appendix A to make sense of this section. Note
also, Appendix A starts giving intuitive description of their construction
without ever describing ITK/notations. I suggest the authors revise the
discussion of Appendix A and bring it to the main body.


(pg 5) Meanwhile for senders --> receivers

Fig 1: Should KG be outputting ek_i instead of vector{ek_i}?

(pg 10) You repeat the same condition for when ek_i s are known and unknown

(pg 11) integer weight.Later --> missing space after period

Fig 5: Sig.kg() doesn't specify MAC key generation. This also does not
specify how h hat is initialized

(pg 18) predicates.generalize forward-secrecy --> remove the period

Section 3: The mmPKE construction directly encrypts the secrets as compared
to [50]. This is not explained (although the authors added a footnote in
Appendix A)

Scientific quality
------------------
This paper considers a very important and relevant question in my opinion.
saCGKA could significantly improve the efficiency of CGKA and thereby, of
SGM. However, the current formalization has some important limitations
(please see my comments above) and the manuscript is of poor editorial
quality. So I don't feel this is ready for publication yet.

\begin{verbatim} Paper summary
-------------
The known continuous group key agreement (CGKA) constructions always require linearly or logarithmically growing communication cost w.r.t the group seize.
This paper proposed a new Server-Aided CGKA (saCGKA) that can impressively reduce the bandwidth, from both the sender and receiver side.
In order to construct saCGKA, this paper also introduces some novel primitives, such as "multi-message multi-recipient PKE" (mmPKE) and "Reducible signatures" (RS), that are of independent research interest.
The security of the proposed saCGKA protocol is proven in the UC model. At the end of this paper, empirical data is also provided, which shows that saCGKA has significantly better performance on the efficiency compared to TreeKEM, the well-known CGKA in the MLS standard.

Novelty, methodology and technical correctness
----------------------------------------------
Q1: No.

Q2: Yes.

Q3: No.

Technical quality
-----------------
Q4: Yes.

Comment: The saCGKA protocol, which is also your core construction is missing. This prevents readers from underhanding your main contribution in the main body, and one has to read the non-mandatory material.

Editorial quality
-----------------
Q5: Yes.

Comment: I enjoyed reading most of your paper until I found the main saCGKA protocol is missing in your main body.
In Section 1, the motivation, research target, the related work, and the background are explained clearly.
In Section 3 - 5, you introduce the primitives, the constructions, and the respective security experiment along with the proof in details.
Both the intuition and the details of the security model are comprehensively explained in Section 6.
In Section 7, you briefly clarify the weaker and stronger winning condition and proved the security of saCGKA.
The efficiency evaluation in Section 8 is fantastic. The figures are nice-looking and reader-friendly.

However, the organisation is terrible -- to be accepted this paper should include the core construction in the paper.
I would suggest you to reduce Section 3 - 5 or simply move them into supplementary files and spend more space on your core construction in the main body.


Typo:
- 1. [P7] "and if [m : n] := \emptyset if n < m" => "and [m : n] := \emptyset if n < m"
- 2. [P8, Figure 1] "for i in [N] do (eki, dki) <- KG()": remove the arrow above eki
- 3. [P8, Figure 1] "{eki : i in [N] \ Corrupted}" => "{eki : i in [N]} \ Corrupted"
- 4. [P11] "integer weight.Later, it is" => "integer weight. Later, it is" (adding a space)
- 5. [P11, Definition 4] "Vrfy(acc, x, \pi) = 1" => "wVrfy(acc, x, \pi) = 1"
- 6. [P12, Figure 3] "wVrfy(acc, \pi, x) " => "wVrfy(acc, x, \pi) "
- 7. [P18] "The confidentiality and authenticity predicates.generalize ..." => "The confidentiality and authenticity predicates generalize"

Scientific quality
------------------
Q6: The current known CGKA constructions always require high computation efforts, in particular, when the group size is large.
Designing some novel constructions for the high efficiency in the group messaging is definitely a very important open question that is in need of improvement.

Q7: The saCGKA protocol effectively solves the research question. The instantiation SAIK has not only theoretical but also empirical good performance.
For instance, in a group with 10K users, a message transmission requires 1.5MB in TreeKEM but only 2.2KB in their SAIK instantiation.
The only weakness in your construction is the underlying assumption: The Double-Sided Strong Diffie-Hellman (DSSDH) assumption is not a standard assumption.
\end{verbatim}



\item \begin{verbatim} Paper summary
-------------
Continuous Group Key Agreement (CGKA) can be seen as the KEM component of
group messaging: A number of connected users interact with each other,
establishing a series of (hopefully) secure keys that they then use to
symmetrically encrypt messages to each other. The central CGKA challenge is
to establish these keys with strong security guarantees (eg IND with
FS+PCS) and, at the same time, be efficient with that.

This submission considers a novel CGKA protocol that is optimized for a
specific network topology: Users are connected to each other only via a
central (untrusted) server. If Alice wants to send messages to all other
group members, she prepares one big message that she sends to the server
which then extracts and forwards the specific parts for each addressee.
Overall, this approach promises a drastic improvement on bandwidth
requirements. The authors indicate that their solution scales up to 10k+
users.

As the central server is not trusted, the extraction operations it performs
have to be security neutral. One particular challenge is that if the
original sender wants to authenticate its message, then the many individual
receivers have to be able to verify the sending with access to only their
partial share of the message. To this end, the authors introduce Weighted
Accumulators and Reducible Signatures as authentication building blocks.
They are constructed around a Merkle Tree that is Huffman-organized rather
than balanced, meaning that membership proofs have different sizes that can
be controlled, and thus optimized, by the sender. I really liked that idea!

Overall this work is technically impressive and the practical implications
very valuable. However I also found this submission difficult to judge
because the overall contribution is not clear. This is in particular the
case because the Merkle+Huffman technique is actually not new (in contrast
to what the authors seem to claim) but entered security research already
15+ years ago (reference below).

Novelty, methodology and technical correctness
----------------------------------------------
Q1: yes, the Merkle+Huffman technique was already proposed 15 years ago
(see above/below) Q2: yes Q3: no

Technical quality
-----------------
The submission alternatingly presents somewhat lightweight findings and
technically ambitious work. On the lightweight side: (1) The mmIND-RCCA
results (Sec 3) are nice but not groundbreaking (EC is not the adequate
platform to present them; I was indeed surprised that the authors chose to
give them so much space in the paper.) (2) Constructing Reducible
Signatures from Weighted Accumulators (Sec 5) is straightforward and rather
a matter of diligently working out the details. On the ambitious side: (3)
I really found the Huffman-shaped Merkle tree idea inspiring (Sec 4).
However, the work of

Muñoz et al, TrustBus 2005, DOI:10.1007/11537878_13 "Efficient Certificate
Revocation System Implementation: Huffman Merkle Hash Tree"

seems to already have introduced it, with a related application in mind, a
long time ago. (4) The new security model for saCGKA. It looks very good
indeed, but the authors say that it is based on [Alwen et al, TCC'20], and
the differences are not documented in (the main body of) the submission. I
am not sure how to assess its contributions.


REQUEST TO AUTHORS: In your rebuttal, please explain what Sec 4 contributes
on top of the findings of [Muñoz et al].

Editorial quality
-----------------
In general, very good editorial quality. But here are some random
suggestions (no need to rebut any of these!):

It is quite unfortunate that the authors didn't manage to integrate a
specification of their SAIK protocol in the main body of the paper.

As a general writing style, I suggest the authors communicate more
technical details of their findings in the intro. For instance, I'd have
loved to find a hint on Huffman codes already on p.4. I'd also have loved
to read in the intro paragraph of Sec 5 that the authors will just turn
their wAcc into a signature scheme. Further, the "security model" part on
p.4 should clarify on whether the proposed model is weaker or stronger than
that of prior works, sketching also the differences and implications.

I didn't understand anything of the opening paragraph of Sec 5.2. I guess
this has to do with the fact that the authors refer to details about their
CGKA protocol which they actually never expose in (the main body of) the
submission.

I feel Theorem 4 (page 24) is the main result of this submission.
Unfortunately the statement is not accessible to me as it refers to "F_AKS
from Fig.14" which is in appendix and not otherwise mentioned in the main
body.

p.4: "possible, because" -> "possible because" p.9: What is "DSSDH" ? p.9:
What is an "additive factor"? p.11: "weight.Later" -> "weight. Later" p.12:
"of concatenated" -> "of the concatenated" p.12: please add citation after
"is minimal." p.12: "length depends" -> "lengths depend" p.15: In
Fig.4/Oracle Sign: "Oracle Sign(vk',...)" -> "Oracle Sign(sk',...)" p.15:
In Fig.4/Oracle Verify: "sigma,rp" -> "rp,sigma" (twice) p.15: Right above
Def 9, what does the "E" in "AEUF" stand for? p.16: "senders" -> "sender's"
p.18: "predicates.generalize" -> "predicates generalize" p.18: "extends
history" -> "extends a history" p.24: Relaxed -> Replayable (for
consistency with e.g. the last line of p.3) p.25: "sender uploads" ->
"senders upload"

Scientific quality
------------------
Not much to add to the above.

Def 4: I really have trouble with this definition. It seems to say that the
adversary is expected to forge proof pi *before* the accumulator is
created. In more detail: The adversary first specifies X, then an
accumulator for X is created via (possibly randomized) acc<-wEval(X), but
the adversary is expected to output the acc-offending pair (x,pi) already
before that, namely in the very first step of the experiment. It seems that
only deterministic wAccs (where acc is a function of X) can ever fulfill
this notion. Maybe it makes sense to weaken the definition a little? (In
addition, please correct "Acc"->"wAcc" and "Vrfy"->"wVrfy".)


REQUEST TO AUTHORS:

You say your CGKA protocol supports 10k+ users, but you also say (on p.17)
that if two users simultaneously create epochs (e.g., add a new user) then
the history graph splits. If one has 10k+ users on a channel, very likely
such graph splits will happen. Please explain what your protocol does to
re-serialize a graph after a split.
