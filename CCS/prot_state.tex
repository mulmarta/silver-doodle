The state of $\saik$ consists of a number of variables, outlined in \cref{tab:prot-state}. The table also includes short
descriptions of the roles of the secrets in the key schedule. The protocol will ensure that states of any two parties in the same epoch differ at most in labels of nodes of $\itkSt.\tree$ that describe secret keys and the label $\itkSt.\leaf$. This means that they agree on the secrets $\itkSt.\applicationSecret$ and $\itkSt.\initSecret$, as well as on the public context, computed by the helper method in \cref{tab:prot-state}.
