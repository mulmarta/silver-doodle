The state of $\saik$ consists of a number of variables, outlined in \cref{tab:prot-state}. The protocol will ensure that states of any two parties in the same epoch differ at most in labels of nodes of $\itkSt.\tree$ that describe secret keys and the label $\itkSt.\leaf$. This means that they agree on the secrets $\itkSt.\applicationSecret$ and $\itkSt.\initSecret$, as well as on the public context, computed by the helper method in \cref{tab:prot-state}.
