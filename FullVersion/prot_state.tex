The state of $\saik$ consists of a number of variables, outlined in \cref{tab:prot-state}. The table also includes short
descriptions of the roles of the secrets in the key schedule, which is extended by the intermediary secrets described in
\cref{tab:prot-intermediate-state}. The protocol will ensure that states of any two parties in
the same epoch differ at most in labels of nodes of $\itkSt.\tree$ that describe secret keys and the label
$\itkSt.\leaf$. This means that they agree on the secrets $\itkSt.\applicationSecret$ and $\itkSt.\initSecret$, as well
as on the public context, computed by the helper method $\groupContext()$ in \cref{tab:prot-state}.
